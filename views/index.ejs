<h2>Monster Hunter Helper ðŸŽ®</h2>

    <!-- the /monster route is being guided to monster folder and shows the monsters.ejs and whats in it -->
   <p>
  This website provides guindance for players, and can give a faster way to access
  information they need to enhance their experience. For example, the Monster's weakness and
  its items drops. Once the player clicks on the Monster it will show what the
  monster drops, and can make their judgement wether this Monster is worth their
  time. This helpful information can also be used to see the many
  attributes of an Armor piece and its stats, and the same can go for the weapons. Happy hunting!
