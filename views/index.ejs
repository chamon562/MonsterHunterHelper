    This website provides guindance for players, and can give a faster way to
    access information they need to enhance their experience. For example, the
    Monster's weakness and its items drops. Once the player clicks on the
    Monster it will show what the monster drops, and can make their judgement
    wether this Monster is worth their time. This helpful information can also
    be used to see the many attributes of an Armor piece and its stats, and the
    same can go for the weapons. Happy hunting!
