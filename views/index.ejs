  This app can provide guindance for players, and give a faster way to access
  information they need for their items. For example, the Monster weakness and
  its items drops. Once the player clicks on the Monster it will show what the
  monster drops, and can make their judgement wether this Monster is worth their
  time. This helpful information can also be used to see the different
  attributes of Armor and its stats, and the same can go for the weapons. Also
  pictures always adds the cool factor how the armor looks along with the
  Monster they would have to face. Happy hunting they would say.
